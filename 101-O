in the best case
O(n) - when the list is already sorted, a single forward and backward pass is
enough.

in the average case
O(n^2) - the average time complexity involves multiple passes where each pass
involves a linear scan, leading to a quadratic time complexity in most cases.

in the worst case
O(n^2) - the worst-case scenario occurs when the list is in reverse order,
requiring a maximum number of swaps and passes to sort the list.
